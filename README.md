# NUS Money API â€“ NodeJS

Using u1i/nodejs-api as the start point, this project is for learning Docker containers and the CI/CD piepline using the NUSmoney app in the following progressive steps.  With a very basic starting knowledge, it may not be possible to complete all steps by project show and tell date but will try to make as much progress as possible.

A. Fully understand each step to setup and run app.js (from u1i/nodejs-api repo) with nodejs as a backend API service in a Docker container.  Within Google Cloud Shell Editor, be able to manually clone, build and start the service in a Docker container rather than just being able to start the service that lecturer has deployed in Google Cloud.

B. Replicate step 1 for the NUSmoney app.  Add javascript files for NUSmoney app backend and learn how to run it as a backend API service in a Docker container.  To achieve this, need to learn how to install MYSQL client in the Docker container when setting it up.  Aside from the learning value, this would have addressed a real problem faced during the NUSmoney project.  After the NUSmoney backend was completed, each front end developer who wanted to test their front end application's interaction with the backend had to manually copy and install the backend components then run the API service before testing the front end.  Using the Docker container would have simplified all that.

C. Automate the setup, build, publish and deploy for the NUSmoney app in github workflow using a yaml file so that any changes to NUSmonay app are automatically deployed.

Document the testing and lessons learnt, as there will be many.

A. Setup and run app.js
1. Fork u1inodejs-api to create this repo.
2. Start Google Cloud Shell Editor and run following.
3. git clone https://github.com/eTZapl20/nodejs-api => clones the source from github into "local" VM instance started up by Google Cloud Shell Editor
5. cd nodejs-api => change directory to nodejs-api
6. docker build . -t nusmoney => builds the docker container executing each line in Dockerfile, which include installing various packages needed
7. docker run -d -p 8080:8080 nusmoney => runs the app.js API service within the Docker container at port 8080 => this is done by executing the instruction found in the CMD line in the Dockerfile => the instruction is to run the shell script start.sh => the shell script contains instruction to run node app.js, therefore starting or running the API services found in app.js
8. curl -i http://localhost:8080/fx => test by calling the API end point (at port 8080) using curl command.

CI/CD pipeline implemented using GitHub Actions:

* create docker container
* push to gcr.io container registry
* deploy to Google Cloud Run (knative / PaaS)

The CI/CD build workflow needs documentation. For now, here is how you connect it to GCP: [https://gcp-examquestions.com/ci-cd-solutions-deploy-to-google-cloud-run-using-github-actions/](https://gcp-examquestions.com/ci-cd-solutions-deploy-to-google-cloud-run-using-github-actions/)

In order for this to be provisioned on your Google Cloud instance, you need to make sure you create/update these GitHub secrets:

* GCP_APPLICATION
* GCP_CREDENTIALS
* GCP_EMAIL
* GCP_PROJECT

You'll also need to activate a couple of APIs in Google Cloud, the first deployment will probably fail and point you into the right direction. Alternatively, you could deploy the first version manually.
